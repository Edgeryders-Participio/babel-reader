"<p>One of the men in balaclavas is handed a note by the cashier. It said: “you have beautiful eyes.”<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://bbu.world/uploads/babelbetweenus/original/1X/1a0079538fe3d953fe221052a169b5d45486c00c.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://bbu.world/uploads/babelbetweenus/1a0079538fe3d953fe221052a169b5d45486c00c\" title=\"BEAUTIFUL EYES.jpg\"><img src=\"https://bbu.world/uploads/babelbetweenus/optimized/1X/1a0079538fe3d953fe221052a169b5d45486c00c_2_666x500.jpeg\" alt=\"BEAUTIFUL%20EYES\" data-base62-sha1=\"3I1qDtCCY0r5bJbDX326GIztfPK\" width=\"666\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://bbu.world/uploads/babelbetweenus/optimized/1X/1a0079538fe3d953fe221052a169b5d45486c00c_2_666x500.jpeg, https://bbu.world/uploads/babelbetweenus/optimized/1X/1a0079538fe3d953fe221052a169b5d45486c00c_2_999x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://bbu.world/uploads/babelbetweenus/optimized/1X/1a0079538fe3d953fe221052a169b5d45486c00c_2_1332x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://bbu.world/uploads/babelbetweenus/optimized/1X/1a0079538fe3d953fe221052a169b5d45486c00c_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\">\n<svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">BEAUTIFUL EYES.jpg</span><span class=\"informations\">4032×3024 2.53 MB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg>\n</div></a></div></p>\n<p>Her eyes tenderly meet his. He looks back down to the note for some time, then scans back to her face. She beams shyly and pinkly.</p>\n<p>He has never been told such a thing like this before and a prickly flush creeps under the hot black wool on his face. This mixed with the adrenaline of the terror-excitement (terrorcitement?) of his first heist could cause him to malfunction. He can’t have that.</p>\n<p>He screws the paper up in one hand and flicks it in her face. She barely blinks. He aims the gun between her eyes.</p>\n<p>“Bitch, I said put the cash in the bag or I’ll shoot your fucking teeth out!”</p>\n<p>She slowly and delicately picks at the bundles of money under the counter, placing it all in the duffle bag as if she’s lovingly preparing a child’s lunch bag. She’s entered a daydream in which her and the man have gone on a romantic evening. She’s wearing a smashing dress and he makes her twirl in it. She has no idea what his face looks like, so she’s just imagining him in the balaclava still, but wearing a crisply ironed shirt. His hazel eyes remind her of amber in sunlight with the longest, prettiest eyelashes she’s ever seen on a boy….</p>"
